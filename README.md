# 🧪 PROJECT 1 - MASTER'S DEGREE IN CYBERSECURITY

Hey there! 👋  
This repository contains the first project from the Master's Degree in Cybersecurity. The assignment: **"Replicate the homepage of a real website using only HTML and CSS"**.
In this case, I decided to use **Singularu** (an online jewelry store 💍) as a reference, with no functionality or interaction — just the visual design.

## 💡 What’s included?

- Header with logo and navigation menu.
- Main banner or hero image.
- Highlighted sections (based on the original layout). 
- Footer.
- Basic styles applied with CSS.

## 🛠 Technologies used

- **HTML5** – For structuring the content  
- **CSS3** – For styling and visual layout  

No JavaScript, no frameworks, no extra magic. Everything was hand-coded from scratch to practice the fundamentals.
